# DECISIONS — append-only. Why things are the way they are (so we never relitigate).

D-01 | Google Sheet = database (not SQL/Airtable) | Client already lives in Sheets; zero learning curve;
full client visibility; AppSheet-ready for Phase 3 CRM face.
D-02 | Personal OneDrive handled via Make connection (client OAuth'd once) | No M365 tenant exists; no
admin center; connection tested OK ("My Drive"). Risk logged as CR-003.
D-03 | SMS channel mapped to WhatsApp | Client's SOP names SMS templates, but WhatsApp is where clients
are; Twilio = extra cost/complexity. Revisit only if client insists.
D-04 | Client codes start YM-2026-00001 | Client: "koi bhi set kar do" (2026-07-24/25).
D-05 | Claude API on CLIENT's key/billing | Engagement Letter promise ("API usage runs on Yale's own
keys"); Haiku for classification (volume 20–50/day ≈ dollars/month), Sonnet for drafting.
D-06 | AI drafts NEVER auto-send; only RMA gives migration advice | Legal/compliance rule encoded in
every SOP + our proposal. Conservative routing with Needs-Review path.
D-07 | Everything built inside client-owned accounts, we hold invited access | Ownership promise in
Proposal + Engagement Letter; makes handover trivial.
D-08 | Automation Google account (the empty one client gave) = the automation workspace | Repurposed
2026-07-24; MASTER DATABASE lives there; scripts deploy under it → client ownership preserved.
D-09 | Build order M2→M3→M4/M5→M6→M9 | Data layer first (everything reads it); folders = fastest
visible win (client priority #1); WhatsApp channel deferred inside M6 until Meta verification.
D-10 | Workspace tracking: this repo + PROJECT-STATE.md + auto-memory | Session ritual in CLAUDE.md;
survives long chats/device switches; git history = audit trail.
